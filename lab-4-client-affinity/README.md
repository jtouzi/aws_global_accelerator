## Lab 4 - Client Affinity
If we want AWS Global Accelerator to direct all requests from a user at a specific source (client) IP address to the same endpoint resource (to maintain client affinity), we can change the "Client Affinity" from "None" (default) to "Source IP" for the listener.

Let's see how AWS Global Accelerator will handle requests from Herndon.

### Comments

US-WEST-2 has two endpoints, but only one processed the 100 requests because they were all from the same IP address.

### Resources
Client Affinity: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-listeners.html#about-listeners-client-affinity
